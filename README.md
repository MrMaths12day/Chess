# RoboChess - ElecSoc
#### Robotics Officer - Joe Biju
A smart chessboard that utilises hall effect sensors to detect the position of pieces to relay to a chess.com API, combined with a robotic system to move the pieces according to the computer's decision.

The project covers fields across electronic, software, and mechanical engineering. I lead it as part of UCD ElecSoc's Robotics Club, where four projects are selected and funded for the year to promote STEM and encourage students to learn about electronics. I work with students from varying backgrounds and skills weekly, teaching them different engineering concepts related to the project.
